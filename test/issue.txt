issue 11: incorrect result, improper cliper position with 12.ass.
more: on videos with 720 x 400 resolution, the result is correct, but on 1280 x 720, the result is wrong. Turn off compiler option /arch:SSE2, both resolutions above get the right result. It also applies to Issue 7. Maybe /arch:SSE2 option affects some internal floating point caculation such that an overflow occur. (fixed)

==============================================================
issue 23: poor performance for unsorted embedded ass subtitles. With such subtitles, rasterizer::Draw function is called far more frequently then both external subtitle and sorted embedded subtitle. Steps to reproduce it: 
	choise 1: mix 21.ass with any video into .mkv, play it and watch OSD info. It will show that Cache LV 1 gets unreasonable high query count. 
	choise 2: mix 22.ass with any video into .mkv, play it and watch OSD info. It will show that total query count of Cache LV 1 is 4 times, while using the subtitle as external subtitle or sorted before mixing, Cache LV 1 gets queried 3 times totally. (fixed)
